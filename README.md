# UltInterface
## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
This project aims to make Interface crossplatform. It uses each Interface libraries for each OS and... Well, you get the idea.

## WAIT!
**This project is still in development, and it most likely won't work. (At the moment of typing this literally nothing's written yet... yeah)**

## DEPENDENCIES
For now, none.
But here's the ones that are likely to be used:
* TKinter (Windows)
* GTK4 (Linux)
* GTK4 (MacOS)

### Why GTK4 for MacOS?
Because i feel it fits the MacOS style.

## SEVERAL WARNINGS
1. I don't have an access to a MacOS operating system so if you have one, feel free to contribute. My main OS is Linux (Mint).
2. Yes, i know that Windows, Linux and MacOS are not the only ones that are OSes, so if you have other OS or, hell, YOUR own OS, then again, feel free to contribute.
3. Not all Interface Libraries have the certain UI elements (Buttons, checkboxes, etc.). While it does sound dissapointing, i'm sure we'll find a way around this problem.
4. I'm in the 9th grade, and because of that, most likely i will be rarely contributing to it.
